Notes from August 29 2022:

- Worked on modeling data in Whimsical <https://whimsical.com/versions-and-values-DVLU8JuwqgbEG3MDyQF8zr>
- Will we need a database or not? TBD
- Need to redo our data collection to get the following materials:

**All Data Types:**
- Topics/Search:
  - need to rewrite topics and search to work for multiple languages of DH <https://github.com/WeKeyPedia/convergences/blob/3828f5c182ed71bee3d05352c925159b420b27d5/data/en.Digital%20humanities.json> DH, Humanités numériques (but make sure to use exact words, i.e. "digital humanities")
  - also need to redo our initial get data repos to work with topics tagged and search

- Languages (only programming, not natural languages)
  - could use description to determine natural language (maybe Google API?)

- Users
  -

## Next Steps

1. rethink initial queries for different languages - one data file per language query (combining search and tagged topic repos - two searches and drop dups)
2. For each repo list, get all associated user accounts - one file of users per language query.

3. Now recursion (and brain f*) - 
  - for each user, need list of all public repositories. Check repos against our known list. Make list of new repos. 
  - for each user, get list of followers
  - for each user, get list of following
  - for each user, get list of organizations

*Make sure we focus on DH community exclusively!* Allow follow ups on other communities and their relationship to DH

Next session do live coding to refactor the data_generation scripts
