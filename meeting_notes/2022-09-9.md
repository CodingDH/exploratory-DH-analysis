# Notes from meeting:

- Discussed code reorganization and archived earlier datasets and scripts

Next Steps:

1. Get watchers, starrers, etc... of tagged/search repos
2. Get repos, followers, orgs of contributors to tagged/search repos (not the repos for the watchers and starrers, yet)
   1. Get all repos for users and then we will check how many overlap with our core set
3. After this data push, start working on data analysis
