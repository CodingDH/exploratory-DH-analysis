# Topics

- Overview of code to date
- Decided to do analysis for the paper at this stage - using the repos recovered from a search for "digital humanities"
- Note that this is not "DH" as that is too hard to differentiate.

# Planning for Paper
- Considering github as an archive -> focus for now on question of what data can we get and what does it how us
- Save questions of indepth study of who writes code for later versions.

DH proposal due Friday.

Reconvening Tuesday to continue planning.
