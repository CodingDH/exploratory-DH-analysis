Notes for October 3 Meeting:

JW: 
Questions ahead - 

- Do we want the next layer of repositories (repositories owned by the users identified in the initial queries)? And do those go into the repos dataset after checking for duplicate status?
- As we gather followers, subscribers, do those go into the users dataset in addition to the join dataset?
- How are we using the search_queries_join_dataset? should I record the requests for connected followers and/or repos here as well? Or is this primarily calls to the search api?
- We should chat about the stackbit-projects and gitter-badger users.
