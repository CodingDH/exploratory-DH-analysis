# Topics Covered

Zoe: 
- Search queries and the distribution of their results
  - Compared to expanded search
  - Limits of Search API (no discussions, projects, wiki)
- Core users
    - how that is being defined and computed
    - What does the thresholding produce
    - Intentional engagement with DH vs penumbra of activity

For later papers, thinking about the repositories that users follow / star / use
- software generated by the DH community vs software used by the DH community


Jeri: 
- Initial user exploration
  - Trends between different types of users (intentional DH vs penumbra, also linguistic communities?)
- Question of orgs (Jeri to run user-org script to fill out this data)

# Planning for Paper
- focus on the users for the JDH paper and the challenge of getting data from Github
    - issues in Github for historical research - lack of time stamp and versioning for user behavior (code is well documented, but users are not)
    - size of data from Github and the constraint
    - ethics of scraping data and user consent
- Also comparison of Github to scholarship on web and social media archives
